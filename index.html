    <h2>Top 5 Benefits of Microsoft Azure for Business</h2>
<img src="./Microsoft.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
      1.Perfect for small businesses and established enterprises — Azure is
      designed for every business regardless of size, from the local bakery to
      multi-national corporations. It’s easily scalable to meet your IT demands
      and operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model to meet any budget. Since
      businesses can launch and store internal and external applications in the
      cloud, it also saves on in-house IT costs, including hardware and
      maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
     2. Complements and expands your current IT infrastructure — Azure allows your
      IT personnel to focus on your business without having to worry about
      in-house capabilities or maintaining equipment that is over-taxed or
      underused. The platform makes it fast and easy to deploy your current apps
      with little to no downtime. An integrated development environment reduces
      the learning curve, allowing teams to master the platform quickly.
      Additionally, the platform has a footprint in more countries than Google
      or Amazon, providing faster content delivery while optimizing the user
      experience. Azure is scalable to grow with your company, and you pay for
      only what you need.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.Leading the way with IaaS and PaaS — At the forefront of IaaS and PaaS,
      Azure offers rapid deployments. The hybrid cloud environment allows
      companies to select whether they operate autonomously or utilize a public
      cloud. You are also able to decide the level at which you are connected to
      the internet, if at all. Meet all your IT and service needs without having
      to maintain the underlying infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.Security, compliance, and disaster recovery — Microsoft understands the
      importance of security and has designed Azure to stay ahead of the
      competition when it comes to protecting your data. Azure has many
      compliance certifications and is a top choice of high-risk industries such
      as health care and government to provide cloud services. Both the platform
      and end users are protected. Additional services such as multi-factor
      authentication and sophisticated disaster recovery abilities that can
      restore data in a matter of hours further address business needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Industry-specific applications — Due to the high-risk and sensitive nature
      of certain industries, Azure has designed specific applications to address
      unique needs. Government, health care, manufacturing, and financial
      services benefit greatly from Azure’s many features, including offline
      cloud services, individualized security needs, simplified compliance, and
      modernized customer apps.
